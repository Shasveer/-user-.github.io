# Welcome to my portfolio!

*Hi, my name is Shasveer Ramchander, I am currently a learner at shaper, who is doing a learnership towards data science. I am a well-motivated person who will be using my skills and knowledge I gain to be a data analyst.*

# My Target Role:
My target role will be to become a data analyst, as I would like to make a difference in the financial sector. Also, I will clean, collect, and organize raw data. I chose this role because without a data analyst a project cannot be complete to the best of its ability since the data being used will be raw and not cleaned so you will not be able to get accurate information regarding the project. 

# My Projects Ideas Are As Follows: 
1. I would like to create a campaign that makes customers in the financial sector aware of the different types of frauds and scams going around i would like to do this campaign threw social media platforms, by analyzing data to see who is a higher risk to being victim of a scam/fraud. 

2. Another project I would like to get involved in would be to fraud detection in transactions where I will create a machine learning model that will detect fraudulent transactions to help improve security in the financial sector. 

 # One Techinical Skill:
One technical skill I would like to grown in is Python as I have never used it before, but it will be beneficial to me, I will be gaining knowledge on something new, also python focuses on data analyst projects, were it shall help me clean data, handle nulls, duplications and compare campaigns. 

# One Soft Skill:
One soft skill will be communication as I am currently deaf, so communication with others verbally is a disadvantage as I'm not able to understand the next person. Communication is a key factor for a data analyst as it prevents misinterpretation of data, helps with recommending actions and making decisions. 

# My 30-Day Goal:
My 30-day (about 4 and a half weeks) goal as an upcoming data science student would be to build a solid practical foundation in the data science world, by learning the fundamentals of python and data manipulation. 

# My 6-Month Goal:
My 6-month goal as an upcoming data science student would be to build a portfolio with a couple end to end projects, portraying my skills, which I have developed over the past 6 months, for example, visualization, data manipulation and data cleaning.
